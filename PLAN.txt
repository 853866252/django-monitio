I fix a bug:
    => open some messages
    => click 'close all'
    => try sending some more messages
    => there will be a bug on JS console

I add a functionality:
    => to enable or disable notifications via e-mail and via sse
        .. using signals
        .. monitio.notify_email.enable() in urls.py

    => notification runs:
        .. after transaction is commited
        .. using django-post-transaction-signals package

I create selenium integration tests for the above notifications

I add a fallback eventsource to poly-fill missing EventSource in older browsers:
    => via jquery eventsource
    => ... and this does not work too good
    =>

I add a functionality, which is a django template tag to delete non-anonymous
comments for a given user from a web page, that contain a link to web page. Use
case:
- "Hi, this is message X, please click here to read the report"
- user clicks
- user enters a web page
- message is CLOSED (or marked as read) even before user enters the page
To avoid unnecessary mess.

I create a celery task to remove messages, that are read for more than 48 hrs

I create documentation

==============================================================================
DONE:

I create tests for:
    => storage
    => notify
    => models
    => api
