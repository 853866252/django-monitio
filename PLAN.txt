** POSSIBLE RACE CONDITION: if JS gets 2 messages with THE SAME PK, it should
DISCARD the 2nd message. As this has not yet appeared, I'm not implementing
this.

Functionality, which is a django template tag to delete non-anonymous
comments for a given user from a web page, that contain a link to web page. Use
case:
- "Hi, this is message X, please click here to read the report"
- user clicks
- user enters a web page
- message is CLOSED (or marked as read) even before user enters the page
To avoid unnecessary mess.

Celery task to remove messages, that are read for more than 48 hrs
