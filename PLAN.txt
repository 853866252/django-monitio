Functionality, which is a django template tag to delete non-anonymous
comments for a given user from a web page, that contain a link to web page. Use
case:
- "Hi, this is message X, please click here to read the report"
- user clicks
- user enters a web page
- message is CLOSED (or marked as read) even before user enters the page
To avoid unnecessary mess.
